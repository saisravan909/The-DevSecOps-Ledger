# Contributing to The DevSecOps Ledger

We are so glad you're here! To keep the "Ledger" clean, please follow these steps:

### 1. Propose an Idea
Start a thread in the **Discussions** tab before writing a long document. This ensures no one else is already working on it!

### 2. Format
- Use **Bold** for key terms.
- Provide a "How-To" or "Tool" suggestion for every problem.
- Link to official sources (like OWASP or NIST).

### 3. The 72-Hour Rule
We use **Lazy Consensus**. Once you submit your change (Pull Request), if no one objects within 3 days, we merge it!
